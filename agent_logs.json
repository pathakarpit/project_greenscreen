An operation is defined as either increasing the current element or inserting a new element with the value of the next element in the array.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. Input: `arr = [1, 4, 5, 9, 1]`\nOutput: `2` (Increase the middle two elements to make the array palindrome)\n\n2. Input: `arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`\nOutput: `0` (The input array is already a palindrome)\n\n3. Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\nOutput: `4` (Increase the middle three elements to make the array palindrome)\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n* The length of the input array `n` will be between `1` and `10^6`.\n* The values in the input array will be non-negative integers.\n\nNote that this problem assumes that the input array can be modified. If the input array is immutable, the number of operations would need to be adjusted accordingly."

    "response": "## Time Complexity Analysis\n\n* The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.\n* The loop runs exactly N/2 times, which is equivalent to O(N) because we're considering the worst-case scenario where we have an even number of elements.\n* Inside the loop, we perform a dictionary lookup `if x in dict` which takes O(1) time on average. This is because dictionary lookups are typically implemented as hash table operations, and they can be performed in constant time.\n* Therefore, the total time complexity is N * O(1) = O(N).\n\n## Space Complexity Analysis\n\n* The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.\n* We use a dictionary/hash map to store at most N elements.\n\n## Step-by-Step Reconstruction Logic\n\n* Initialize an empty dictionary (not explicitly shown in the code, but implied) and two variables `n` and `operations`.\n* Set `n = len(arr)` to get the number of elements in the input array.\n* Loop from `i = 0` to `i = n//2 - 1` (inclusive). This is because we're only considering the first half of the array, and we want to avoid duplicate pairs by only iterating over the upper half of the array.\n* Inside the loop, check if `arr[i] != arr[n-i-1]`. If this condition is true, it means that the current pair of elements does not match. In this case:\n\t+ Increment `operations` by the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[n-i-1]`, i.e., `abs(arr[i] - arr[n-i-1])`.\n* After the loop completes, return the value of `operations`.\n\nNote that if no pair is found (i.e., all elements are equal), the function will not modify the `operations` variable. In this case, it will simply return 0.\n```"
