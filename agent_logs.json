If there is a tie, we compare the first digit to break it. The resulting sorted string will represent the largest concatenated number.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. Input: [\"2\", \"21\", \"12\"]\n   Output: \"1212\"\n   Explanation: The largest concatenated number formed by these strings is 1212.\n   \n2. Input: [\"3\", \"30\", \"33\"]\n   Output: \"3330\"\n   Explanation: The largest concatenated number formed by these strings is 3330.\n\n3. Input: [\"1\", \"11\", \"13\"]\n   Output: \"31113\"\n   Explanation: The largest concatenated number formed by these strings is 31113.\n\n**Constraints:** \n* N <= 10^5 (where N is the maximum length of any string in the input list).\n* All numbers in the input list are non-negative.\n* No leading zeroes will be present in the output."

Initialize Variables\n\n*   Initialize an empty list `nums` to store the input numbers.\n*   Initialize an empty string `largest_num` to store the largest concatenated number.\n\n### 2. Remove Non-Digit Characters and Sort Numbers\n\n*   Iterate through each number in `nums`.\n    *   Use a generator expression with `filter(str.isdigit, num)` to remove non-digit characters from the number.\n    *   Join the digits back together using `''.join(...)` to form a string of digits.\n    *   Use the `sort` method with a custom comparison function (`custom_compare`) to sort the numbers in descending order. The custom comparison function compares two numbers by concatenating them in both orders and determining which one is larger. If one number is larger, return -1. If one number is smaller, return 1. If they are equal, return 0.\n*   After sorting, `nums` will contain the sorted list of strings representing the input numbers.\n\n### 3. Concatenate Sorted Numbers\n\n*   Use `''.join(nums)` to concatenate all the sorted numbers together into a single string `largest_num`.\n\n### 4. Handle Leading Zeroes\n\n*   Check if `largest_num` has more than one digit and its first character is '0'.\n    *   If this condition is true, return '0' because a leading zero in a multi-digit number makes it invalid.\n    *   Otherwise, proceed to the next step.\n\n### 5. Return Largest Concatenated Number\n\n*   Finally, return `largest_num` as the largest concatenated number that can be formed from the input numbers."
