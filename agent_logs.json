    "response": "### Time Complexity Analysis\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N). This might seem counterintuitive at first because we use a while loop. However, if you analyze it carefully, **the loop runs N times**, and the dictionary lookup `if x in dict` takes O(1) time on average.\n\nTherefore, N * O(1) = O(N).\n\n### Space Complexity Analysis\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(N), as we use a dictionary/hash map to store at most N elements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reconstruction Logic\n\n#### Initialize Variables\n*   The `n` variable is initialized with the length of the array `arr`.\n*   Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively.\n\n#### Find the Pivot Point (If Rotation Exists)\n*   A while loop runs from the beginning of the array until it finds a pivot point where rotation starts. In each iteration, we check if the current element is greater than or equal to the next one.\n    *   If `left` is less than `n` and `arr[left]` is less than or equal to `arr[(left + 1) % n]`, increment `left`.\n*   If no rotation exists (`left == n`), set `left` back to 0. Otherwise, adjust the right pointer considering the rotation.\n\n#### Binary Search with Two Pointers\n*   We start a while loop that continues until `left != right`. In each iteration:\n    *   Calculate the current sum of elements at indices `left` and `right`.\n    *   If the sum equals the target (`current_sum == target`), return True, indicating that a pair has been found.\n    *   If the sum is less than the target (`current_sum < target`), increment the left pointer using `(left + 1) % n`. This ensures we wrap around to the beginning of the array if necessary.\n    *   If the sum exceeds the target (`current_sum > target`), decrement the right pointer using `(n + right - 1) % n`.\n\n#### Return Statement\n*   If no pair is found after iterating through the while loop (i.e., `left == right`), return False.\n\nThis detailed step-by-step reconstruction should enable any developer to recreate the provided code based on this explanation."
