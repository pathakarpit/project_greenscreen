# Professor's Analysis: Chocolate Distribution Problem

This is a complete analysis of the given Python code. The time complexity is O(N) because the loop runs N times and dictionary lookup takes O(1) time on average. The space complexity is also O(N) as we use a dictionary/hash map to store at most N elements.
