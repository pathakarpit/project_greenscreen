--- PROBLEM STATEMENT ---
```
**Title:** Reverse Array
**Description:**
Given an array of integers, reverse the order of its elements.
**Examples:**

1. Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, Output: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
2. Input: `[-1, 0, 1]`, Output: `[1, 0, -1]`
3. Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, Output: `[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

**Constraints:**

* The input array is non-empty and contains only integers.
* The length of the input array is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).

## Time Complexity Analysis
### Big O Notation:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N).
### Explanation:

* The loop runs N times, where N is the number of elements in the list.
* Inside the loop, we perform a dictionary lookup `if x in dict` which takes O(1) time on average, because dictionary lookups are constant-time operations in Python.

## Space Complexity Analysis
### Big O Notation:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N).
### Explanation:

* We use a dictionary/hash map to store at most N elements. In the worst-case scenario, all elements will be stored in the dictionary, resulting in a space complexity of O(N).

## Step-by-Step Reconstruction Logic
### Variables Initialization:
* `nums` is initialized with the input list.
### Loop Condition:
* The loop runs until `i >= 0`.
### Finding Complement:
* Inside the loop, we calculate the complement by subtracting the current number from the target: `target - current_num`.
### If/Else Logic:
* If the complement is found in the dictionary (i.e., `if x in dict`), it means that a pair has been found. In this case, we return the index of the current number.
* If the complement is not found, we continue to the next iteration.
### Return Statement:
* If no pair is found after iterating through all numbers, we return -1 (or any other default value).

Here are the steps in bullet points:

* Initialize `nums` with the input list.
* Iterate over the list using a for loop.
* In each iteration:
	+ Calculate the complement by subtracting the current number from the target: `target - current_num`.
	+ Check if the complement is already in the dictionary (i.e., `if x in dict`).
	+ If found, return the index of the current number.
	+ If not found, continue to the next iteration.
* If no pair is found after iterating through all numbers, return -1 (or any other default value).
