DSA PROBLEM 3: Minimum Time to Complete All Tasks

PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a list of tasks, where each task takes a certain amount of time to complete.
You also have K workers who can work in parallel.

Each worker can only work on one task at a time, and tasks cannot be split between workers.

Your goal is to determine the minimum time required to complete all tasks if tasks are assigned optimally.

OBJECTIVE
Given an integer array tasks[] and an integer K, find the minimum possible time needed to finish all tasks.

INPUT FORMAT

Integer array tasks[] of size N
tasks[i] represents the time required for the i-th task

Integer K representing the number of workers

OUTPUT FORMAT

A single integer representing the minimum total time required

CONSTRAINTS

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000

1 ≤ tasks[i] ≤ 10^9

1 ≤ K ≤ N

EXAMPLE 1
Input
tasks = [3, 2, 3]
K = 3

Output
3

Explanation
Each worker takes one task.
Maximum time taken by any worker = 3.

EXAMPLE 2
Input
tasks = [1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
K = 2

Output
11

Explanation
Optimal assignment:
Worker 1 → [1, 2, 8] = 11
Worker 2 → [4, 7] = 11

Total time = 11.

EXAMPLE 3
Input
tasks = [5, 5, 5, 5]
K = 1

Output
20

EXPECTED TIME COMPLEXITY
O(N log S)
(where S is the sum of all task durations)

EXPECTED SPACE COMPLEXITY
O(1)

HINT

The answer lies between max(tasks) and sum(tasks)
