--- PROBLEM STATEMENT ---
**Title:** Find Minimum and Maximum Values in a Collection

**Description:**

Analyze the raw content provided by the Tech Researcher above. Develop an algorithm that finds the minimum and maximum values in a given collection of integers using the Linear Scan approach. Initialize two variables to hold the current minimum and maximum values, then iterate over each element in the collection. For each element, compare it with the current minimum value; if it's smaller, update the minimum value. Similarly, compare each element with the current maximum value; if it's larger, update the maximum value.

**Examples:**

1. Input: `arr = [3, 2, -6, 5, 0]`
Output: Minimum Value: `-6`, Maximum Value: `5`

2. Input: `arr = [-10, -20, -30]`
Output: Minimum Value: `-30`, Maximum Value: `-10`

3. Input: `arr = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]`
Output: Minimum Value: `100`, Maximum Value: `500`

**Constraints:**

* The input collection `arr` contains only integers.
* The size of the input collection `n` is at least 2 and at most 10^5 (i.e., 1 <= n <= 10^5).
* The range of integer values in the collection is from -10^9 to 10^9.

--- PROFESSOR'S EXPLANATION ---
## Time Complexity Analysis

* The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array `arr`.
* This is because the loop runs exactly N times, once for each element in the array.
* Inside the loop, we perform a dictionary lookup `if x in dict` which takes O(1) time on average. However, since this operation occurs within the loop, its overall contribution to the time complexity is negligible compared to the O(N) loop itself.
* Therefore, the overall time complexity remains O(N).

## Space Complexity Analysis

* The space complexity of this algorithm is also O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array `arr`.
* This is because we use a dictionary/hash map to store at most N elements.

## Step-by-Step Reconstruction Logic

### Initialize Variables

* We initialize two variables: `minimum` and `maximum`, both set to infinity (positive and negative, respectively).
* These variables will be used to track the minimum and maximum values seen so far in the array.

### Loop Over Array Elements

* The algorithm iterates over each element `num` in the input array `arr`.
* For each element:
	+ We check if it's less than the current `minimum`. If so, we update `minimum` to this value.
	+ We check if it's greater than the current `maximum`. If so, we update `maximum` to this value.

### Return Minimum and Maximum Values

* Once all elements in the array have been processed, the algorithm returns the final values of `minimum` and `maximum`.
* These are the minimum and maximum values seen in the input array.

Note that if the input array is empty, the algorithm returns `(None, None)`, indicating that no valid minimum or maximum value was found.
