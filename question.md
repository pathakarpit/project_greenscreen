## Problem Statement

**Title:** 
Minimum Element in Rotated Sorted Array


**Description:**
The input array `nums` is a rotated sorted array, meaning it was initially sorted but then rotated (shifted) some number of positions, potentially more than once. Find the minimum element in this array.

**Examples:**

1. Input: `nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`
Output: `1`

2. Input: `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`
Output: `0`

3. Input: `nums = [1]`
Output: `1`


**Constraints:**
*   The input array `nums` is not empty.
*   The length of the input array `nums` can be up to `10^5`.
*   The elements in the input array `nums` are all integers.
*   The array `nums` contains at least one element.
