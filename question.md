**Title:** Check if Array Contains Duplicates

**Description:** Given an integer array arr[], check if the array contains any duplicate value.

**Examples:**

* Input: arr[] = {4, 5, 6, 4}
Output: true
Explanation: 4 is the duplicate value.

* Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: false
Explanation: All values are distinct.

* Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Output: false
Explanation: No duplicates in the array.

**Constraints:** 
- The size of the input array is within the range 1 <= N <= 10^5.
- Each element in the array is an integer with a value between -10^9 and 10^9.
