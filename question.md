## Problem Statement

**Title:** 3-Sum Problem
**Description:** 
Find all unique triplets in an array that sum up to a specific target value.
The problem can be divided into two categories based on whether the input array is sorted or unsorted. Examples include finding all triplets with zero sum, finding all triplets with a given sum, and finding the triplet with the sum closest to a given value.

**Examples:**

*   All Triplets with Zero Sum:
    *   Input: [-1, 0, 1]
    *   Output: [(-1, 0, 1), (0, -1, 1), (0, 1, -1)]
*   All Triplets with Given Sum:
    *   Input: [2, -4, 5]
    *   Output: [(2, -4, 5), (-2, 4, -5)]
*   Triplet Sum Closest to Target:
    *   Input: [-1, 0, 3]
    *   Output: [(-1, 0, 3) and (0, -1, 3)]

**Constraints:** 
N >= 3
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9

Note that the Constraints have been defined assuming the problem is to find triplets with a given sum. If the problem is to count the number of triplets or find other types of triplets, different constraints may be required.

All unnecessary text has been removed from the raw input, leaving only the Problem Statement, Examples, and Constraints.
