## Problem Statement

**Title:** Product of Array Except Self

**Description:**

Given an array `arr` of integers, return an array where each element at index `i` is the product of all elements in `arr` except for `arr[i]`.

### Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `arr = [10, 3, 5, 6, 2]`
   - Output: `[180, 60, 36, 30, 90]`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Output: `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `arr = [0, 1, 0, 3]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`

### Constraints:

- The length of the input array is at most `10^5`.
- The elements in the input array are non-negative integers.

Note: This problem does not require any additional constraints beyond those mentioned above.
