## Problem Statement

**Max Water Trapped**
=======================
**Description:**
The problem asks to find the maximum water that can be trapped between lines in an array. This is achieved by treating every line as both the left and right boundaries of a container.
**Examples:**

* Input: `[1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]`
Output: `49`

* Input: `[1, 1]`
Output: `0`

* Input: `[4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5]`
Output: `9`

**Constraints:** 
- The input array will contain only positive integers.
- The length of the array can be up to 10^5.

- Note: Since there are no explicit constraints in the problem statement, I've added some reasonable ones for better understanding. 

Please let me know if this is correct!
