## Problem Statement

**Title:** Maximum Subarray Sum

**Description:** Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of all subarrays within it.

**Examples:**

1. Input: `[2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3]`
Output: `10` (the maximum sum is achieved by taking the subarray `[7, -1, 2, 3]`)
2. Input: `[5, 6, -4, 3, -1]`
Output: `11` (the maximum sum is achieved by taking the subarray `[5, 6, 3]`)
3. Input: `[-10, 20, -15, 30, -25]`
Output: `35` (the maximum sum is achieved by taking the subarray `[30]`)

**Constraints:** The input array will have at most 1000 elements, and all elements will be integers between -10000 and 10000.

Note that I have removed any solution code and only provided a clear problem statement.
