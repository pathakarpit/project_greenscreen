## Problem Statement

```
Title: Implement QuickSelect Algorithm
Description:
Implement the QuickSelect algorithm to find the kth largest element in an array of integers.

Examples:
Example 1:
Input: arr = [12, 7, 9, 8, 3, 5], k = 2
Output: The 2nd largest element is: 9

Example 2:
Input: arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], k = 1
Output: The 1st largest element is: 50

Example 3:
Input: arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], k = 2
Output: The 2nd largest element is: 4

Constraints:
- The input array arr contains n integers.
- 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

Note:
The QuickSelect algorithm works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around it. It then recursively selects the kth largest element from the appropriate partition.
