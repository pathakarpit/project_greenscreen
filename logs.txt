Title: Kosaraju's Theorem
Description:
Given a graph G = (V,E), find all articulation points in the graph.
An articulation point is a vertex that, when removed, increases the number of connected components.

Examples:
Input 1:
- Graph G = ({A,B,C,D}, {(A,B),(B,C),(C,D)})
Output 1:
- Articulation points: B

Input 2:
- Graph G = ({A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}, 
    {(A,B), (B,C), (C,D), (D,E), (E,F), (F,G), (G,H), (H,I), (I,J),
     (J,K), (K,L), (L,M), (M,N), (N,O), (O,P), (P,Q), (Q,R), (R,S),
     (S,T), (T,U), (U,V), (V,W), (W,X), (X,Y), (Y,Z)})
Output 2:
- Articulation points: M, N

Input 3:
- Graph G = ({A,B,C,D,E}, {(A,B),(B,C),(C,D),(D,E)})
Output 3:
- No articulation points

Constraints:
1. Number of vertices (N) is between 1 and 10^5.
2. Each edge has a weight, but it's not used in the algorithm.

Note: I invented reasonable constraints as there was no information about them.

[95m## Final Answer:[00m [92m
This Python code defines a class called `Solution` with two methods: `dfs` and `solve`. The class uses depth-first search (DFS) to find all strongly connected components in an input graph. 

The algorithm initializes various data structures such as `graph`, `stack`, `visited`, `low`, `ids`, `id`, and `scc_count` based on the input graph.

The `dfs` method takes a vertex `at` as input, marks it as visited, assigns an id to it, recursively calls itself for all unvisited adjacent vertices, and updates the `low` dictionary accordingly. 

If a vertex has finished being visited (i.e., `low[at] == ids[at]`), it pops all vertices from the stack that are not `at`, removes them from the `visited` set, and increments the `scc_count`.

The `solve` method iterates over all vertices in the graph, calling the `dfs` method on unvisited vertices. 

After visiting all vertices, the algorithm returns a list of indices corresponding to strongly connected components (i.e., vertices whose id is not present in the `ids` dictionary).

This code uses a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of vertices in the graph. The space complexity is also O(N) as we use dictionaries and stacks to store at most N elements.[00m

        1. Try to access the Official URL: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-and-minimum-in-an-array/
        2. If that fails (403/404), use 'Internet Search' to find: "Maximum and Minimum Element in an Array geeksforgeeks problem".
        3. CRITICAL: The search results will contain 'link' fields. COPY one of those links exactly. DO NOT GUESS A URL.
        4. CRITICAL: When searching, ignore pages like "Complete Guide", "Syllabus", "GATE Notes", or "file list".
        5. Look for specific tutorial pages, e.g., containing "algorithm", "problem", or "tutorial" in the title.
        6. Use 'Website Scraper' on that new link.
        7. Extract:
           - Problem Statement.
           - At least 3 Input/Output Examples.
           - Constraints.

For any comparison-based sorting algorithm, the minimum number of comparisons required in the worst case to sort an array of n elements is O(n log n). Hence, the number of comparisons made in this approach is O(n log n).

[Better  Approach I] Iterating the array - O(n) Time and O(1) SpaceThe idea is to perform a single traversal, firstly initialize two variables - mini as INT_MAX and maxi as INT_MIN, then traverse the array to update mini whenever a smaller element is encountered and to update maxi whenever a larger element is found. Number of Comparisons:Worst Case: 2 * n comparisons (n for minimum, n for maximum).Best Case: 2 * n comparisons (no optimization possible).

Many programming languages provide an inbuilt sort() function that sorts collections (like arrays, lists, etc.) in ascending order. Once the collection is sorted, the minimum value is at the 0th position, and the maximum value is at the nth position (where n is the size of the collection).

vector<int> arr = {1, 423, 6, 46, 34, 23, 13, 53, 4};
// Implemented inbuilt function to sort the vector
sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
// After sorting, the value at the 0th position will be the minimum

OutputMinimum element of array: 1
Maximum element of array: 423
Approach:  Linear Scan Method - O(n) time and O(1) spaceThe approach used here is a linear scan to find the minimum and maximum values in a collection, specifically in a vector in this case. We start by assuming the first element of the collection is both the minimum and the maximum. Then, as we iterate through the collection, we compare each element to the current minimum and maximum. If an element is smaller than the current minimum, we update the minimum; if it's larger than the current maximum, we update the maximum. This continues for all elements in the collection, and at the end of the loop, we have the minimum and maximum values.

An appropriate method for finding the minimum and maximum values in a collection is the Linear Scan approach. This technique involves initializing two variables to hold the current minimum and maximum values, then iterating over each element in the collection. For each element, compare it with the current minimum value; if it's smaller, update the minimum value. Similarly, compare each element with the current maximum value; if it's larger, update the maximum value. After iterating through all elements, both variables will hold the actual minimum and maximum values of the collection.

Here is a generic implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int getMin(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int minVal = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++)
        if (arr[i] < minVal)
            minVal = arr[i];
    return minVal;
}

int getMax(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int maxVal = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++)
        if (arr[i] > maxVal)
            maxVal = arr[i];
    return maxVal;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> testArray = {1, 423, 6, 46, 34, 23, 13, 53, 4};
    std::cout << "Minimum value in the array: " << getMin(testArray) << "\n";
    std::cout << "Maximum value in the array: " << getMax(testArray) << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This code initializes `minVal` and `maxVal` to the first element of the array, then iterates over the rest of the elements. If it encounters a smaller or larger number, respectively, than its current minimum or maximum, it updates those values.

Similarly, here's how you could implement this method in other languages:

- **C:** Similar to C++ but using `#include <stdio.h>` and possibly `limits.h` for `INT_MIN`.
- **Java:** Uses `Math.min()` and `Math.max()` methods within a loop.
- **Python:** Utilizes built-in `min()` and `max()` functions directly in a loop, although there's no need to explicitly loop through all elements if you use these functions.
- **C#:** Similar to Java but with the `.NET` Math library.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the collection, and space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of additional memory.[00m

**Title:** Find Minimum and Maximum Values in a Collection

**Description:**

Analyze the raw content provided by the Tech Researcher above. Develop an algorithm that finds the minimum and maximum values in a given collection of integers using the Linear Scan approach. Initialize two variables to hold the current minimum and maximum values, then iterate over each element in the collection. For each element, compare it with the current minimum value; if it's smaller, update the minimum value. Similarly, compare each element with the current maximum value; if it's larger, update the maximum value.

**Examples:**

1. Input: `arr = [3, 2, -6, 5, 0]`
Output: Minimum Value: `-6`, Maximum Value: `5`

2. Input: `arr = [-10, -20, -30]`
Output: Minimum Value: `-30`, Maximum Value: `-10`

3. Input: `arr = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]`
Output: Minimum Value: `100`, Maximum Value: `500`

**Constraints:**

* The input collection `arr` contains only integers.
* The size of the input collection `n` is at least 2 and at most 10^5 (i.e., 1 <= n <= 10^5).
* The range of integer values in the collection is from -10^9 to 10^9.

[95m## Final Answer:[00m [92m
## Time Complexity Analysis

* The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array `arr`.
* This is because the loop runs exactly N times, once for each element in the array.
* Inside the loop, we perform a dictionary lookup `if x in dict` which takes O(1) time on average. However, since this operation occurs within the loop, its overall contribution to the time complexity is negligible compared to the O(N) loop itself.
* Therefore, the overall time complexity remains O(N).

## Space Complexity Analysis

* The space complexity of this algorithm is also O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array `arr`.
* This is because we use a dictionary/hash map to store at most N elements.

## Step-by-Step Reconstruction Logic

### Initialize Variables

* We initialize two variables: `minimum` and `maximum`, both set to infinity (positive and negative, respectively).
* These variables will be used to track the minimum and maximum values seen so far in the array.

### Loop Over Array Elements

* The algorithm iterates over each element `num` in the input array `arr`.
* For each element:
	+ We check if it's less than the current `minimum`. If so, we update `minimum` to this value.
	+ We check if it's greater than the current `maximum`. If so, we update `maximum` to this value.

### Return Minimum and Maximum Values

* Once all elements in the array have been processed, the algorithm returns the final values of `minimum` and `maximum`.
* These are the minimum and maximum values seen in the input array.

Note that if the input array is empty, the algorithm returns `(None, None)`, indicating that no valid minimum or maximum value was found.[00m

[95m## Final Answer:[00m [92m
To reverse an array in various programming languages, we can use the following methods:

1. **Using Two Pointers**: Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning and end of the array respectively. Swap the elements at these two positions and move the pointers towards the center of the array.

   ```python
def reverseArray(arr):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
```

2. **Using the Reversal Algorithm**: Reverse each subarray of consecutive `k` elements in place.

   ```python
def reverseInGroups(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(0, n, k):
        left = i
        right = min(i + k - 1, n - 1)
        while left < right:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```

3. **Using the In-Place Algorithm**: Reverse the array in place by swapping adjacent elements.

   ```python
def reverseArrayInPlace(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        arr[i], arr[n - i - 1] = arr[n - i - 1], arr[i]
```

4. **Using the Recursion Algorithm**: Reverse the array using recursive function calls.

   ```python
def reverseArrayRecursively(arr, start, end):
    if start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        reverseArrayRecursively(arr, start + 1, end - 1)
```

5. **Using the Iterative Algorithm**: Reverse the array using a while loop.

   ```python
def reverseArrayIteratively(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    i = 0
    while i < n // 2:
        arr[i], arr[n - i - 1] = arr[n - i - 1], arr[i]
        i += 1
```

These are just a few examples of how to reverse an array in various programming languages. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.[00m

## Time Complexity Analysis
### Big O Notation:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N).
### Explanation:

* The loop runs N times, where N is the number of elements in the list.
* Inside the loop, we perform a dictionary lookup `if x in dict` which takes O(1) time on average, because dictionary lookups are constant-time operations in Python.

## Space Complexity Analysis
### Big O Notation:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N).
### Explanation:

* We use a dictionary/hash map to store at most N elements. In the worst-case scenario, all elements will be stored in the dictionary, resulting in a space complexity of O(N).

## Step-by-Step Reconstruction Logic
### Variables Initialization:
* `nums` is initialized with the input list.
### Loop Condition:
* The loop runs until `i >= 0`.
### Finding Complement:
* Inside the loop, we calculate the complement by subtracting the current number from the target: `target - current_num`.
### If/Else Logic:
* If the complement is found in the dictionary (i.e., `if x in dict`), it means that a pair has been found. In this case, we return the index of the current number.
* If the complement is not found, we continue to the next iteration.
### Return Statement:
* If no pair is found after iterating through all numbers, we return -1 (or any other default value).

Here are the steps in bullet points:

* Initialize `nums` with the input list.
* Iterate over the list using a for loop.
* In each iteration:
	+ Calculate the complement by subtracting the current number from the target: `target - current_num`.
	+ Check if the complement is already in the dictionary (i.e., `if x in dict`).
	+ If found, return the index of the current number.
	+ If not found, continue to the next iteration.
* If no pair is found after iterating through all numbers, return -1 (or any other default value).
