Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: Each student gets exactly one packet.The difference between the maximum and minimum number of chocolates in the packets given to the students is minimized.Examples:Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 2. Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 5 Output: 7Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4, 9, 7}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 9 - 2 = 7. Try it on GfG PracticeTable of Content[Naive Approach] By Generating All Subsets[Expected Approach] Using Sliding Window [Naive Approach] By Generating All SubsetsThe idea is to generate all subsets of size m of arr[]. For every subset, find the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in it. Finally, return the minimum difference.[Expected Approach] Using Sliding Window The idea is to use sliding window technique and choose consecutive elements from a sorted array to minimize the difference. After sorting the array, the difference between the maximum and minimum values in any window of size m is minimized. First sort the array arr[] and then use two pointers to maintain a window of size m to find the subarray with the minimum difference between its last and first elements.
